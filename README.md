Conatins solution of some of the regex problems 

Acronyms.py  
Problem : A search engine is badly in need of a feature where it can understand common acronyms, or abbreviations.
To begin with, we’d like it to be able to figure out, the expansions of abbreviations which refer to popular organizations, which might include agencies, colleges, universities or companies. 


Anagram.py
Problem :X is obsessed about reading short stories. Being a CS student, he is doing some interesting frequency analysis with the books. From two short story books, he choses strings having length a from the first and strings having length b from the second one. The strings are such that the difference of length is <= 1

i.e.

|a-b|<=1, where |x| represents the absolute value function.

He believes that both the strings should be anagrams based on his experiment. Your challenge is to help him find the minimum number of characters of the first string he needs to change to make it an anagram of the second string. Neither can he add a character nor delete a character from the first string. Only replacement of the characters with new ones is allowed.



HTMLTags.py
Problem : 
In this problem you will use regular expressions to help you detect the various Tags used in an HTML document.
Here are a few examples of tags:
The “p” tag for paragraphs:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
It is also okay to have one or more spaces before or after the tag name:
<  p >This is also a paragraph</p>  
Then, there is also something called a void or an empty tag such as:
<p></p> 
Some tags can also have attributes. For example, here we see the “a” tag which is used for adding links to a document.
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>  
In the above case, “a” is the tag and “href” is an attribute, the value of which is “http://www.google.com”. Ignore any attributes. Your task is to find out all the tags present in the given document.
There are also tags such as this which haven’t been split into an opening and closing tag (i.e, self-closing tags): ‘< p/>’
